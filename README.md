# human-ffmpeg
A project for making ffmpeg command line use easy for common use cases

 
Question is if there is a usable subset that would cater to many users' needs. And if so, if it would be possible to find out what that might be. For me (jeorgen) it is:

* conversion (lossless, or close to it)
* sound extraction
* trimming
* slow motion  (with intact pitch if ffmpeg is up to it)
* picture-in-picture (speaker + overhead projector)
